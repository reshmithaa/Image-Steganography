# Image-Steganography
Image Steganography Project in Python using Tkinter: The Image Steganography project in Python using Tkinter is a program that hides secret data within an image while preserving its visual appearance. Tkinter is a Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Here's a concise description of the project:

The program allows the user to select an image file and enter a secret message or data to hide.
The GUI built with Tkinter displays the selected image and a text area t type the secret message.
The program converts the secret message into binary format.
It then modifies the pixel values of the image to store the binary data.
The modified image can be downloaded into your local machine with your desired name for it as a new file without significant visual changes.
The program also includes a decoding function to extract the hidden message from a steganographic image.
When decoding, the program retrieves the binary data from the pixel values and converts it back to the original message.
The decoded message is displayed to the user through the GUI along with the decoded image.

In summary, this Python project utilizes Tkinter to create an interface for users to hide secret messages within images using steganography techniques.
